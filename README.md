# `k8s-kms-plugin` 🔐

<!-- Badges: every one is drawn by shields.io with style=flat-square, so they share a height, a
     typeface and a corner radius. GitHub's own actions/workflows/*/badge.svg, pkg.go.dev's badge and
     api.scorecard.dev's badge each render at their own metrics and take no style parameter, which is
     why the shields.io equivalents are used instead. The two rows are deliberate: what the project
     is, then whether it is healthy.

     FORK-LOCAL: the documentation badge and the docs workflow badge below, and the site links in the
     Documentation section, point at THIS FORK because upstream has no Pages site and no docs.yml
     workflow yet. Everything else in this repository uses absolute eclipse-keysealer URLs on purpose.

     BEFORE OPENING A PULL REQUEST UPSTREAM, switch them back:
       nicolas-peiffer.github.io/k8s-kms-plugin -> eclipse-keysealer.github.io/k8s-kms-plugin
       github.com/Nicolas-Peiffer/...           -> github.com/eclipse-keysealer/...
     The other place carrying a fork URL is website/hugo.toml's baseURL, which is only a local-dev
     default — the Docs workflow computes the real one from the repository that runs the build. -->

`k8s-kms-plugin serve` implements the [Kubernetes KMS v2 API](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/kms/apis/v2) protocol as a gRPC service that leverages a remote or local HSM via PKCS11.
`k8s-kms-plugin serve rotation` supports key rotation operations.

Supported `--algorithm-family` values (key size / parameter set is derived at runtime from the HSM key):

- `aes-gcm` — AES-GCM symmetric encryption (128 / 192 / 256-bit)
- `aes-cbc` — AES-CBC symmetric encryption with HMAC-SHA256 authentication
- `rsa-oaep` — RSA-OAEP asymmetric encryption
- `ml-kem` — post-quantum ML-KEM hybrid encryption (CRYSTALS-Kyber / FIPS 203; ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, ML-KEM-1024)

For what each family actually does to the data — keys used, primitives composed, wire format, and which
operations run inside the HSM — see [Cryptographic Schemes](./docs/cryptographic-schemes.md).

This plugin will also run in proxy mode which can connect to a remote plugin service running in a secure network device (Key Managers)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Droping support of KMS v1**: Newer (after 2025) version of the `k8s-kms-plugin` droped support for [Kubernetes KMSv1](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/kms@v0.34.1/apis/v1beta1),
> as KMSv1 is deprecated in Kubernetes v1.28 and disabled by default since Kubernetes v1.29.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is under construction and needs to be updated to remove/archive references to KMS v1 and
> document KMS v2 operations.

# Part of Eclipse KeySealer

`k8s-kms-plugin` is part of [Eclipse KeySealer](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.keysealer),
which brings HSM-backed key management to Kubernetes. It relies on [crypto11](https://github.com/eclipse-keypont/crypto11), [gose](https://github.com/eclipse-keypont/gose)
and [pkcs11-go](https://github.com/eclipse-keypont/pkcs11-go) from the related
[Eclipse Keypont](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.keypont) project for its PKCS#11 bindings. _"Pont"_ is french for "bridge"

# 🚤 Quick Start 🚀

**TL;DR**: For a quick start experience, try the `k8s-kms-plugin` with a software (virtual) HSM, then plug it into a
throwaway Kubernetes cluster:

1. [SoftHSMv3 (`pqctoday-hsm`) & `k8s-kms-plugin`](./docs/hsm-guides/softhsm-v3.md) — **recommended** HSM: supports all algorithm families including ML-KEM
2. [`KinD` & `k8s-kms-plugin`](./docs/kubernetes-guides/kind-kubernetes.md) — **recommended** cluster: single-node Kubernetes on Podman or Docker, deleted in one command

Other HSMs and TPMs (Thales eToken Fusion, YubiHSM 2, SoftHSMv2, TPM emulator), and the other
Kubernetes distribution guide (`k3s`), are indexed in [`docs/README.md`](./docs/README.md).

# Documentation 📚

<!-- FORK-LOCAL: see the note beside the badges at the top — these two links point at this fork and
     must be switched to eclipse-keysealer.github.io before a pull request upstream. -->
📖 **Browse it online: [nicolas-peiffer.github.io/k8s-kms-plugin](https://nicolas-peiffer.github.io/k8s-kms-plugin/)**
— searchable, with a sidebar and a [glossary](https://nicolas-peiffer.github.io/k8s-kms-plugin/docs/glossary/).

The same pages live in [`docs/`](./docs/README.md) and render here on GitHub, so either surface works.
A fork publishes its own copy at `https://<owner>.github.io/<repository>/` once its Docs workflow has
run. Start here:

| Guide | What it covers |
|-------|----------------|
| [Concepts & Architecture](./docs/overview.md) | Terminology, where the plugin sits in the KMS v2 envelope scheme, deployment topologies (single node and HA), key rotation |
| [Cryptographic Schemes](./docs/cryptographic-schemes.md) | What each `--algorithm-family` does to the data: keys, primitives, wire format, and which operations stay inside the HSM |
| [Installation](./docs/installation.md) | Getting a release binary or package, verifying its signature and provenance, `go install`, building from source, container images |
| [HSM & TPM guides](./docs/hsm-guides/README.md) | One page per PKCS #11 provider — software and hardware — plus the matrix of which algorithm families and key sizes were tested on each |
| [Kubernetes integration guides](./docs/kubernetes-guides/README.md) | Making a cluster's `kube-apiserver` encrypt Secrets through the plugin: `KinD` and `k3s` |
| [CLI reference](./docs/cli-user-interface/README.md) | Help output, shell completion, configuration precedence, and the generated [per-command reference](./docs/cli-user-interface/markdown/README.md) and [flag / environment variable / config key table](./docs/cli-user-interface/markdown/cli-env-var-table.md) |
| [Helper tools & scripts](./docs/tools-and-scripts/README.md) | `create-dev-token` for a ready-made SoftHSM token, `grpcurl` scripts to drive the API without a cluster, and the `KinD` staging script |
| [Development & Debugging](./docs/development.md) | Repository layout, running the three test suites, building against `crypto11`/`gose` branches, `delve` and `vscode` debugging |
| [Supply Chain Security](./docs/supply-chain-security.md) | Vulnerability scanning, release signing, and verifying artifacts, container images and SLSA provenance |

Release notes and the KMS v1 → v2 migration record are in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Before opening a pull request, please run:

```sh
make lint            # golangci-lint
