# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

`k8s-kms-plugin` is a gRPC service implementing the [Kubernetes KMS v2 API](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/kms/apis/v2),
backed by a PKCS #11 TPM or HSM. It is part of [Eclipse KeySealer](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.keysealer)
and consumes `crypto11`, `gose` and `pkcs11-go` from [Eclipse Keypont](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.keypont).

Read `CHANGELOG.md` first when touching anything cryptographic — the v1.0.0 entry is the authoritative
record of the KMS v1 → v2 migration, the PKCS#11 binding swap, and every deliberate behavioural choice
(including bug fixes with data-at-rest compatibility implications).

This repo is a **fork used as a playground** to try things out before the work lands upstream at
`eclipse-keysealer/k8s-kms-plugin`. Expect to sync from upstream rather than the fork being the source of truth.

## Commands

`CGO_ENABLED=1` is required everywhere — the PKCS#11 bindings are cgo. The Makefile sets it for you; set
it yourself if you invoke `go` directly.

```sh
make build              # dev build (native arch) -> dist/k8s-kms-plugin
make test               # unit tests: ./pkg/... ./cmd/... with -race
make lint               # golangci-lint run
make lint-fix           # auto-fix the mechanically-fixable findings
make vet                # same check as CI
make coverage           # -> build/coverage.html
make govulncheck        # reachability-aware vuln scan (same as CI)
make check-doc-links    # relative links and #anchors across the docs
make site-serve         # documentation site at localhost:1313/k8s-kms-plugin/
make site               # documentation site -> website/public/
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs exactly `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...`, `go test -count=1 ./...`.

### Running a single test

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -race -run 'TestValidateHexKeyID' ./pkg/providers/
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -race -run 'TestValidateHexKeyID/subtest_name' ./pkg/providers/
```

### Integration and e2e tests (need a PKCS#11 module)

```sh
PKCS11_MODULE=/usr/local/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm3.so make test-integration
PKCS11_MODULE=/usr/local/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm3.so make test-e2e   # also runs `make build`
```

Both suites bootstrap their own ephemeral SoftHSM token through the PKCS#11 API itself
(`C_InitToken`/`C_InitPIN` in each suite's `TestMain`) — no `softhsm2-util` needed. `PKCS11_PIN` defaults to `1234`.

> **Trap:** without `PKCS11_MODULE` both suites exit **immediately and successfully**. A green
> `go test ./...` does *not* mean the PKCS#11 paths ran. Always confirm the variable is set.

ML-KEM needs SoftHSMv3 ([`pqctoday-hsm`](https://github.com/pqctoday-org/pqctoday-hsm), see `docs/softhsm-v3.md`);
AES and RSA paths also work on SoftHSMv2. The e2e suite additionally requires `grpcurl` on `$PATH` — a missing
`grpcurl` **fails** rather than skips.

`tools/create-dev-token/` provisions a *persistent* dev token with one key per algorithm family — handy for
driving `serve` by hand. Development only; it uses well-known PINs and fixed CKA_IDs.

### Fuzzing

`make test` already replays every fuzz target's seed corpus as an ordinary unit test. `make fuzz` additionally
runs the mutation engine (`FUZZTIME=60s` per target by default). A crashing input lands in
`<pkg>/testdata/fuzz/<target>/` — **commit it**, it then becomes a permanent regression seed.

### Regenerating tracked files

These write files that are committed, so re-run them when the underlying source changes:

- `make doc` — after adding or changing any CLI flag or command (regenerates `docs/cli-user-interface/`)
- `make glossary` — after editing `docs/termbase.yaml` (regenerates `docs/glossary.md`; `make
  glossary-check` is the CI guard)
- `make notices` — after changing dependencies (regenerates `NOTICES.md`)

`make doc` is **reproducible**: two runs on the same tree produce byte-identical output, so any
diff is a real CLI change. Keep it that way — a value that varies per run or per machine must not
reach the generated pages. `--output-dir`'s default is a timestamped temp directory, so its
`DefValue` is deliberately overridden with a `$TMPDIR/...<timestamp>` placeholder in `docs.go`;
without that the timestamp lands in two generated files on every run.

Build and CI provenance (`build_commit`, `ci_run_url`, …) goes into the generated front matter only
under `--provenance`, which `k8s-kms-plugin docs` enables automatically when `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true`.
The published documentation therefore records the exact workflow run that built it while the
committed tree stays free of volatile data.

### Documentation links

`make check-doc-links` (`scripts/check-doc-links.py`) verifies every relative Markdown link and
`#anchor` in `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/`. Anchors rot silently, so run it after moving
or renaming anything under `docs/`.

Headings carry **no manual section numbers** — they were removed because a static site generator
derives ordering from the document tree, and the hand-written numbers had already drifted out of
sync with the anchors pointing at them. Do not reintroduce `## 1.`-style numbering; ordering for the
generated CLI pages comes from front-matter `weight`.

Links from `docs/` to files *outside* the docs tree (`scripts/`, `deployments/`, `tools/`, `Makefile`,
Go source, and `README.md` itself) are absolute `github.com/eclipse-keysealer/...` URLs on purpose: a
published site serves only `docs/`, so a relative `../` link would 404 there. Links *between*
documentation pages stay relative. `docs/README.md` states both rules.

`README.md` is a **front door only** (~90 lines): identity, badges, what the plugin is, the algorithm
families, Quick Start, a documentation map, contributing, licence. The manual lives in `docs/` —
`overview.md`, `installation.md`, `usage.md`, `development.md`, `supply-chain-security.md`. Don't grow
the README back; add or extend a docs page and link it from the map.

### Documentation site (Hugo + Hextra)

`website/` holds the site config; **the content stays in `docs/`** and is *mounted* by
`website/hugo.toml`, so `docs/` remains the single source of truth and keeps rendering on GitHub.
`.github/workflows/docs.yml` builds it on PRs and publishes to GitHub Pages from `master`.
`website/README.md` is the reference; the load-bearing details:

- Every docs page needs front matter (`title`, `weight`) and **no `# H1` in the body** — Hextra
  renders the title as the page heading, so a body H1 shows it twice. Adding one is caught by
  building the site, not by any test.
- `markup.goldmark.renderer.unsafe = true` is **required**: Goldmark silently discards raw HTML, and
  the docs use `<details>` for collapsible sections. Losing it drops those blocks with no error.
- Mount `files` patterns need `'! foo'` **with the space**, and exclusions must come **before** the
  catch-all `'**'` — Hugo returns on the first match, so a leading `'**'` disables every exclusion
  after it. Neither mistake warns.
- A `README.md` is not a section index to Hugo; each one is excluded from the bulk mount and
  re-mounted as `_index.md`. A new docs subdirectory with a README needs its own mount.
- The theme is a Hugo Module pinned in `website/go.mod`, deliberately separate from the plugin's
  `go.mod` so it never reaches `go mod tidy`, `NOTICES.md` or `govulncheck`.
- Mermaid and FlexSearch are fetched at build time and re-served with SRI hashes, at versions pinned
  in `hugo.toml` — Hextra's default is `mermaid@latest`. `website/README.md` documents the offline
  build.
- Hugo does **not** need the extended build (Hextra ships precompiled CSS).
- GitHub-style alerts (`> [!NOTE]`, `TIP`, `IMPORTANT`, `WARNING`, `CAUTION`) render in **both**
  places — natively on GitHub, through Hextra's blockquote hook on the site — so they are preferred
  over a blockquote opening with an emoji, and the emoji/`**Note**:` label comes off when converting.
  Nothing may follow the marker on its line: a custom title is Hugo-only and makes GitHub drop the
  alert entirely. Only those five types exist; anything else is a build warning plus a green box.
- The glossary is a Hugo **data** file, not Markdown: Hextra's `glossary` layout reads
  `site.Data.<lang>.termbase` and ignores the page body. `docs/termbase.yaml` is the source (mounted
  at `data/en/termbase.yaml`, excluded from the content mount) and `docs/glossary.md` is generated
  from it so GitHub shows the terms too. Quote every YAML value — an unquoted `PKCS #11` silently
  truncates at the `#`. Definitions must be Markdown-free: they go straight into `<dd>`. The
  `{{</* term */>}}` shortcode must never appear in `docs/` — GitHub renders it verbatim.
- Code fences carry Hextra attributes — `{filename="…",base_url="…",linenos=table,hl_lines=[…]}` —
  parsed by Hugo with no `markup.goldmark.parser.attribute` setting needed. GitHub keeps only the
  first word of the info string and silently drops the rest, so an attribute is a site-only
  affordance: whatever a highlight is meant to say must also be said in the prose.
  `website/README.md` has the conventions (`filename` only when the block *is* that file,
  `linenos=table` never `inline`, and no path duplicated between a comment and the attribute).

`make doc` follows `GITHUB_ACTIONS` for provenance, so CI's "is the CLI reference up to date" check
must pass `DOC_FLAGS=--provenance=false`; otherwise the commit hash it just stamped in guarantees a
diff.

## Architecture

### Where the plugin sits

The plugin occupies exactly one step of the KMS v2 envelope scheme and **never sees `Secret` data** — only the
32-byte DEK seed that `kube-apiserver` asks it to wrap with the KEK held on the TPM/HSM. `kube-apiserver`
derives the DEK and encrypts the object itself. `docs/cryptographic-schemes.md` is the detailed reference for
every algorithm family; read it before changing wire formats.

Transport is **unix socket only** — the TCP/TLS gRPC option was removed because KMS v2 only supports a local socket.

### Provider layer

`pkg/providers/provider.go` defines the one-method-plus-embedding `Provider` interface
(`k8skmsv2.KeyManagementServiceServer` + a `UnaryInterceptor`). `P11` in `p11.go` is the only implementation;
it must embed `k8skmsv2.UnimplementedKeyManagementServiceServer` (required since KMS v0.34.0 moved to upstream
protobuf-go).

Four algorithm families, selected by `--algorithm-family`: `aes-gcm`, `aes-cbc`, `rsa-oaep`, `ml-kem`. The
sentinel `jose.Alg` constants in `p11.go` deliberately use the same string values as the CLI flag slugs, so
`serve.go` casts directly with no mapping table. Key size / parameter set is **not** a flag — it is derived at
runtime from the HSM key (e.g. AES-GCM reads `CKA_VALUE_LEN`).

**ML-KEM is the structural exception.** The other three families produce a JWE. ML-KEM is a KEM, so it emits two
artifacts and puts them in the two fields KMS v2 already provides: the KEM ciphertext goes into
`EncryptResponse.Annotations` (key `kem-ciphertext.k8s-kms-plugin.keysealer.eclipse.org`) and the AEAD-wrapped
seed goes into `Ciphertext`. This keeps `Ciphertext` at ~60 bytes; a JWE compact serialization would not fit
under the 1 kB limit for ML-KEM-768/1024. `Encrypt` and `decryptWithContext` both branch to `p11_mlkem.go`
before the JWE path. Access the annotation only via `putEncapsulation`/`getEncapsulation`.

### Key rotation

`P11` carries two parallel sets of fields: the active ones (`ctx`, `encryptors`, `decryptors`, `kekCkaID`, …)
and `old*` counterparts used for **decryption only**. `Decrypt` routes on `req.KeyId`: matching the active
KEK ID means normal operation, matching `oldKekCkaID` means rotation, anything else is an error.
`decryptWithContext(req, isRotation)` then selects the whole bundle of context/decryptors/algorithm/labels.
Both KEKs can live on *different* HSMs (the `serve rotation` command takes a full second set of `--old-p11-*` flags).

`mu sync.RWMutex` guards `encryptors`, `decryptors` and `oldDecryptors` — these maps are lazily populated on
first use, so concurrent apiserver requests race without it (this was a real fixed bug; see CHANGELOG).

### Size and length limits

`pkg/providers/kmsv2_limits.go` centralizes every bound, with a naming convention that is load-bearing:
`maxKMSv2<Field>Size` = a limit KMS v2 imposes (bytes on the wire), `max<Attr>Size` = a PKCS#11 limit in bytes,
`max<Attr>HexLen` = a PKCS#11 limit in **hex characters** (twice the raw byte count). The hex/raw distinction is
the one that causes bugs: a `CKA_ID` is raw bytes on the token but travels as a hex string through the CLI and
every KMS v2 `KeyId` field. There is a compile-time assertion tying `maxCkaIDHexLen` to `maxKMSv2KeyIDSize`;
keep it intact. Note the annotations budget is *shared* across all annotations (keys included), not per-annotation.

### CLI: Cobra + Viper

`cmd/k8s-kms-plugin/cmd/` holds the root command plus `serve`, `serve rotation`, `docs`, `version`, and PIN entry.

Configuration priority is **CLI flags > env vars > config file > defaults**. Because Viper resolves the values,
flags are generally registered *without* `Flags().StringVar(&x, …)` — values are read from a per-command
`ViperFlags*` struct with `mapstructure` tags, not from package variables.

`viper-patch-sub.go` is essential reading before touching flag plumbing. It works around two upstream quirks:

1. `viper.Sub("section")` loses the flag/env/default priority chain entirely, so `UnmarshalSubMergedE` merges
   the config subsection back into the main Viper config layer before unmarshalling.
2. Cobra's `MarkFlagsMutuallyExclusive` / `MarkFlagsOneRequired` don't see values that arrived via Viper, so
   `InitViperSubCmdE` copies resolved Viper values back into the Cobra flags.

Env var names derive from the **command path**: `serve --p11-pin` → `K8S_KMS_PLUGIN_SERVE_P11_PIN`. Config file
sections mirror the same path (`k8s-kms-plugin.serve`).

Each command validates all user input in `PersistentPreRunE` via `sanitizeViperFlagsServe` /
`sanitizeViperFlagsRotation` — that is the single choke point covering flags, env vars *and* config file values.
`--algorithm-family` is additionally validated at parse time through a `pflag.Value` implementation, so both
paths call the same `validateAlgorithmFamily`.

`--p11-key-id` (CKA_ID) and `--p11-key-label` (CKA_LABEL) are mutually exclusive and one is required; same for
the HMAC pair. `NewP11` resolves whichever was omitted by looking up the other on the token. See
`docs/cli-user-interface/cka-id-vs-cka-label.md`.

### Logging

Standard-library `log/slog` (not logrus), with a custom `trace` level below debug in `pkg/logging`. Text output
goes through `tint`; `--log-format=json` swaps in `slog.NewJSONHandler`. `--log-level=quiet` installs
`slog.DiscardHandler`. Use `slog.Log(ctx, logging.LevelTrace, …)` for trace-level lines.

A PKCS#11 authentication error during `serve` startup makes the process **sleep indefinitely** rather than exit,
so a crash-looping container cannot burn through the token's PIN retry counter and erase it.

## Dependencies

`crypto11`, `gose` and `pkcs11-go` are consumed as **published modules** — `go.mod` has no `replace` directives.
To build against unreleased changes, point `go.mod` at a branch with `GOPROXY=direct go get -u <module>@<branch>`
(README §5.2 has the full cross-repo recipe). Restore published versions before opening a PR — branch
pseudo-versions must not reach `master`.
